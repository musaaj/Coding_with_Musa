## Basic Concepts in Programming
Before you start to code, you need to have basic ideas on the following concepts;
+ value
+ variable
+ expression
+ function

### Value
**Value** is any piece of data that is meant to be processed. In computer programming, we can basically have the following types of value, depending on the programming language;
+ numeric
+ string
+ array
+ object

**Numeric** values are number values such as 1, 0.5, -1 etc. numeric values can be integers, which are numbers without decimal point. Numeric values can also be floats, which are numbers with decimal point. Some programming language can have more types of numeric value while others might even have just one.

**string** is a list of characters. Characters here means any symbol, especially those symbols used in written languages. String is usually indicated by double aphostrope or single aphostrope in various programming language. Example of string can be `"Hello Programming Language"`, `'Programming is awesome!"`, etc

**Array** is a collection of values. An array can be a collection of values of different types or a collection of values of same type. Different programming languages use different notations to denot array. Array can be denoted with pair of [], {}, or (). Examples; `score = [3, 4,10, 8]`

**Object** is a group of values put together as a unit. Object is also called structure in other programming languages such. Object helps you organized your code by grouping related values and processing them as a unit. We will talk about object in our article on objects, however, knowing the basic meaning of object is sufficient for you to start you coding journey.

### Variable
**Variable** is a refrence to value. Variable or **identifier** is used to refer to value from other locations in our program. We can say variables are way of identifying value. In Mathemat
